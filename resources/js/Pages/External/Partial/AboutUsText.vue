        F-Stop is not just a club for serious Photographers or people with expensive cameras;
        it is a club that has been specifically started to help beginners progress with their 
        photography. We meet once a month on the second Wednesday of each month at the NG Church 
        Bonaero Park at 19:00pm. The aim is to bring people together to learn, share and have fun 
        with photography.

        Opening of the Meeting: The Chairman will open the meeting and discuss the latest 
        happenings and upcoming events. The judge will then be introduced, and he/she will 
        present a short lecture with examples of his/her own photos when applicable. After this 
        judging of images will start. The points will be given as “Bronze, Silver, Gold, or COM” 
        or a score out of 15. The judge will also give you feedback on how your photos can be 
        improved to obtain higher points in future, where necessary.
